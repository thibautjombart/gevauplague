  abstract = "Pneumonic plague poses a potentially increasing risk to humans in
              plague nonendemic regions either as a consequence of an
              aerosolized release or through importation of the disease.
              Pneumonic plague is person-to-person transmissible. We provide a
              quantitative assessment of transmissibility based on past
              outbreaks that shows that the average number of secondary cases
              per primary case (R0) was 1.3 (variance = 3.1), assuming a
              geometric probability distribution, prior to outbreak control
              measures. We also show that the latent and infectious periods can
              be approximated by using lognormal distributions with means (SD)
              of 4.3 (1.8) and 2.5 (1.2) days. Based on this parameter
              estimation, we construct a Markov-chain epidemic model to
              demonstrate the potential impact of delays in implementing
              outbreak control measures and increasing numbers of index cases
              on the incidence of cases in simulated outbreaks.",

  abstract = "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been the first
              severe contagious disease to emerge in the 21st century. The
              available epidemic curves for SARS show marked differences
              between the affected regions with respect to the total number of
              cases and epidemic duration, even for those regions in which
              outbreaks started almost simultaneously and similar control
              measures were implemented at the same time. The authors developed
              a likelihood-based estimation procedure that infers the temporal
              pattern of effective reproduction numbers from an observed
              epidemic curve. Precise estimates for the effective reproduction
              numbers were obtained by applying this estimation procedure to
              available data for SARS outbreaks that occurred in Hong Kong,
              Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada in 2003. The effective
              reproduction numbers revealed that epidemics in the various
              affected regions were characterized by markedly similar disease
              transmission potentials and similar levels of effectiveness of
              control measures. In controlling SARS outbreaks, timely alerts
              have been essential: Delaying the institution of control measures
              by 1 week would have nearly tripled the epidemic size and would
              have increased the expected epidemic duration by 4 weeks.",

  abstract = "On 3 August 1900, bubonic plague (Yersinia pestis) broke out in
              Glasgow for the first time during the Third Pandemic. The local
              sanitary authorities rigorously tracked the spread of the disease
              and they found that nearly all of the 35 cases could be linked by
              contact with a previous case. Despite trapping hundreds of rats
              in the area, there was no evidence of a rat epizootic and the
              investigators speculated that the outbreak could be due to
              human-to-human transmission of bubonic plague. Here we use a
              likelihood-based method to reconstruct transmission trees for the
              outbreak. From the description of the outbreak and the
              reconstructed trees, we infer several epidemiological parameters.
              We found that the estimated mean serial interval was 7.4-9.2 days
              and the mean effective reproduction number dropped below 1 after
              implementation of control measures. We also found a high rate of
              secondary transmissions within households and observations of
              transmissions from individuals who were not terminally
              septicaemic. Our results provide important insights into the
              epidemiology of a bubonic plague outbreak during the Third

               always with us. In Europe, the most devastating plagues were
               those from the Black Death pandemic in the 1300s to the Great
               Plague of London in 1665. For the last 100 years, it has been
               accepted that Yersinia pestis, the infective agent of bubonic
               plague, was responsible for these epidemics. This book combines
               modern concepts of epidemiology and molecular biology with
               computer-modelling. Applying these to the analysis of historical
               epidemics, the authors show that they were not, in fact,
               outbreaks of bubonic plague. Biology of Plagues offers a

               Europe and establishes them within a geographical, historical and
