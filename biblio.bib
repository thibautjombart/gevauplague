  abstract = "Pneumonic plague poses a potentially increasing risk to humans in
              plague nonendemic regions either as a consequence of an
              aerosolized release or through importation of the disease.
              Pneumonic plague is person-to-person transmissible. We provide a
              quantitative assessment of transmissibility based on past
              outbreaks that shows that the average number of secondary cases
              per primary case (R0) was 1.3 (variance = 3.1), assuming a
              geometric probability distribution, prior to outbreak control
              measures. We also show that the latent and infectious periods can
              be approximated by using lognormal distributions with means (SD)
              of 4.3 (1.8) and 2.5 (1.2) days. Based on this parameter
              estimation, we construct a Markov-chain epidemic model to
              demonstrate the potential impact of delays in implementing
              outbreak control measures and increasing numbers of index cases
              on the incidence of cases in simulated outbreaks.",
