  abstract = "Pneumonic plague poses a potentially increasing risk to humans in
              plague nonendemic regions either as a consequence of an
              aerosolized release or through importation of the disease.
              Pneumonic plague is person-to-person transmissible. We provide a
              quantitative assessment of transmissibility based on past
              outbreaks that shows that the average number of secondary cases
              per primary case (R0) was 1.3 (variance = 3.1), assuming a
              geometric probability distribution, prior to outbreak control
              measures. We also show that the latent and infectious periods can
              be approximated by using lognormal distributions with means (SD)
              of 4.3 (1.8) and 2.5 (1.2) days. Based on this parameter
              estimation, we construct a Markov-chain epidemic model to
              demonstrate the potential impact of delays in implementing
              outbreak control measures and increasing numbers of index cases
              on the incidence of cases in simulated outbreaks.",

  abstract = "The survival of two strains of Yersinia pestis (avirulent A1122
              and virulent Harbin) on the surfaces of four materials was
              investigated. Viability was evaluated with epifluorescence
              microscopy by using the metabolic stain cyanoditolyl tetrazolium
              chloride and plate counts. Small numbers of cells suspended in
              phosphate buffer survived 2 to 4 h after visible drying on
              stainless steel, polyethylene, or glass and beyond 48 h on paper.
              Cells suspended in brain heart infusion broth (BHI) persisted
              more than 72 h on stainless steel, polyethylene, and glass. Small
              numbers of cells suspended in BHI were still viable at 120 h on
              paper. These data suggest that Y. pestis maintains viability for
              extended periods (last measured at 5 days) under controlled
              conditions.",
